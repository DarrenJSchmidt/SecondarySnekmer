The files necessary to run the Porter 5 and Snekmer Docker container

These files are the edited files originally contained with Porter 5 as well as extra code necessary to allow porter 5 and snekmer to work in the same container.
This will be updated shortly with a shell script that will automatically set up Porter 5 on launch so that the user does not need to set up Porter 5 on their own.
